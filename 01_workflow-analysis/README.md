# 🧪 Workflow Analysis (IN PROGRESS)

## Overview
This module simulates and analyzes microbiology and molecular laboratory workflows across the full **order-to-result lifecycle**, modeled after Epic Beaker-aligned operations.

The project focuses on identifying operational inefficiencies, turnaround time (TAT) variability, and workflow bottlenecks using synthetic but clinically realistic data.

---

## Objectives
- Model end-to-end laboratory workflows (Order → Collection → Receipt → Result)
- Quantify turnaround time (TAT) across workflow stages
- Identify bottlenecks in pre-analytic, transport, and analytic phases
- Simulate event-driven delays affecting STAT and routine testing
- Establish a foundation for Clarity-style SQL analysis

---

## Key Focus Areas

### Turnaround Time (TAT)
Total and stage-level performance across:
- Collection
- Transport
- Laboratory processing

### Workflow Bottlenecks
Identification of delay drivers across:
- Patient locations (ICU, ED, MedSurg, Primary Care, FSED)
- Testing priorities (STAT vs Routine)

### Event-Driven Delays
Simulation of real-world constraints such as:
- Courier schedules (outreach vs inpatient)
- Specimen transport variability
- STAT prioritization breakdowns

### Operational Segmentation
Analysis of workflow performance by:
- Patient location
- Test priority
- Instrument/platform
