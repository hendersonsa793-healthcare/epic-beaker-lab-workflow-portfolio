# Epic Beaker & LIS Case Studies  
Real-world clinical systems troubleshooting, workflow design, and data integrity analysis aligned to Epic Beaker environments.

---

## Overview

This section contains structured case studies derived from real laboratory information system (LIS) workflows and Epic Beaker–aligned build validation.

Rather than presenting isolated issues, these case studies are organized into core **system domains** that reflect how clinical systems analysts evaluate and troubleshoot laboratory workflows.

Each case demonstrates how configuration decisions at the system level impact:

- Clinical operations
- Data integrity
- Workflow efficiency
- Reporting and downstream systems

---

## System Domains

### 1. Workflow Logic & Event-Driven Design
Cases in this domain focus on alignment between system workflows and real laboratory processes.

Key concepts:
- Event-driven workflow design
- Reflex testing logic
- Order-to-result lifecycle segmentation

Example:
- Blood culture reflex workflow design misalignment

---

### 2. Clinical Mapping & Configuration Logic
Cases in this domain highlight gaps between clinical requirements and system configuration.

Key concepts:
- Specimen source → workflow mapping
- Media selection based on clinical context
- Alignment with microbiology SOPs

Example:
- Missing Thayer-Martin media for genital cultures

---

### 3. Interface & Integration Behavior
Cases in this domain focus on how systems communicate across instruments, LIS, and Epic Beaker.

Key concepts:
- Instrument ↔ LIS interface behavior
- Order structure dependencies
- Message parsing and data transmission consistency

Example:
- Panther LIS order retrieval failure (single-order accession condition)
- Blood Culture Receiving Failure Due to Specimen Source Configuration Change

---

### 4. Data Model & Source Standardization *(expanding domain)*
This domain captures issues related to how data is structured and captured at order entry.

Key concepts:
- Specimen source standardization
- Field redundancy (source vs site)
- Structured vs unstructured data capture

Examples (in progress):
- Catheter-related specimen source limitations
- Source vs site duplication
- Respiratory specimen structure limitations

---

## Case Study Methodology

Each case study follows a structured clinical systems analysis approach:

1. Problem identification  
2. Workflow and system context  
3. Investigation and pattern analysis  
4. Root cause hypothesis  
5. Action and escalation  
6. Outcome (when applicable)  
7. Analyst insight (Epic Beaker / LIS perspective)

---

## Key Insight

Across these domains, a consistent pattern emerges:

> System configuration decisions, especially in order build, workflow design, and interface logic can propagate across the entire order-to-result lifecycle, impacting clinical workflows, data quality, and reporting accuracy.

## Epic Beaker & LIS Alignment

These case studies demonstrate applied understanding of:

- Epic Beaker order build and accession structure  
- Event-driven workflows and reflex testing design  
- LIS interface behavior and edge case handling  
- Workflow validation during implementation  
- Alignment between system design and real laboratory operations  

---

## Notes

All examples are de-identified and presented for professional development purposes.

These case studies reflect how clinical systems analysts evaluate, validate, and improve laboratory workflows within Epic Beaker and LIS environments.
